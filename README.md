# WindowProxy Spec Sketch

This is a first attempt at a more rigorous spec for [WindowProxy](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#the-windowproxy-object). This was prompted by [W3C Bugzilla Bug 27502](https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=27502).

This shouldn't be taken as "official," or implemented: it's just a place to store the work before it moves to a real spec like WebIDL or HTML.
